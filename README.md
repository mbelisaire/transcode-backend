### Java Backend of a transcoding web application

I had a **school team project** to realize. The subject was to create a **web application** able to let a user **transcode** videos from one format to another. 
I fully coded the backend, in **Java**, so I am sharing this part of our project with you today. Feel free to send me feedbacks.
